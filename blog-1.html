            <h2 class="mb-3"><b><u>Why our past experiences can have a direct impact on our health</u></b></h2>
			<p>I will be focussing on why our past experiences can have a direct impact on our health. I will be exploring the impact of prolonged stress, our beliefs and perceptions, including the notion of traumatic beliefs can create illness and disease in the body.</p>
			<p>The body is perfectly equipped and programmed to maintain perfect health. The health breaks down when the body’s natural ability is impaired, due to chemical imbalances which are a result of high stress levels that include the frequency and duration of being in the stress response.</p>
			<p>When we live in high or prolonged periods of stress due to factors such as financial stress, lack of social support, family issues, break ups, loss of loves ones just to name a few, it can lead to illness and disease.</p>
			<p>Stress stems from the perceptions and beliefs that are rooted in our subconscious mind. The ideas and beliefs that were programmed into our subconscious mind at an early age are often harder to identify. It is these deep seated old beliefs that are most often the cause of illness and disease because they are running in the mind like a background program and they are often responsible for initiating the fight/ flight response, keeping us trapped in the stress response for prolonged period and causing the body’s to become unbalanced; weakening the immune system and affecting the organs of receiving essential chemicals.</p>
			<p>Traumatic Beliefs are old belief systems usually developed as a result of a traumatic life experience, just to name a few examples are sexual abuse, being assaulted, attacked or bullied, childhood neglect, being deserted or betrayed.  These traumatic experiences are not just stored as thoughts or memories in the mind but actually stored as ‘code’ in our cells.</p>
			<p>Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was a Russian physiologist most known for his work in classical conditioning. Pavlov devoted study to brain function. Further work on reflex actions involved involuntary reactions to stress and pain.</p>
			<p>Pavlov became best known for what he described as the "conditioned reflex." Pavlov's research led him to conclude that all acquired habits, and even higher mental activity, depend on chains of conditioned reflexes. The conditioned reflex works by association. Rather than a simple stimulus-response mechanism, the conditioned reflex is associated with memory.</p>
			<p>For example, during the shock and stress of an event that is perceived as a physical or emotional threat, a special complex of hormonal messenger molecules are released by the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. These substances encode all the external and internal sensory impressions of the perceived threat as cellular memory. This initial stimulus, or memory, can later act as a catalyst for the same reflex response that was initiated by the perceived threat. The reflex or response can then become conditioned to produce the same basic reaction each time the memory of the initial threat is activated, regardless of the stimulus. This process is known as stimulus generalization. Stimulus generalization is a key element in understanding, and treating, victims of trauma. When we consider that all of the information associated with the trauma is encoded at the cellular level.</p>
			<p>Each individual will respond to trauma differently and have a different perception of what actually constitutes a traumatic experience, depending upon the degree to which the traumatic situation is acknowledged and reviewed within themselves. Still, all of the "memory" associated with the trauma is encoded in the cells, and unless decoded, that cellular memory can serve as the nucleus for psychological and/or psychosomatic illness via the "conditioned reflex." The more frequently the memory is activated via stimulus generalization, the greater the effect is on the mind-body complex, and the more likely the individual is to express the various imbalances that eventually manifest into illness and disease. With the growing research into mind-body therapies over the past two decades a number of therapeutic ‘tools’ have come to light that can serve as methods for decoding, or at least perceptually reframing, traumatically encoded cellular memory patterns.</p>
			<p>By establishing the ability to cope with the traumatic memories, the conditioned reflex mechanisms become decoded at the cellular level, discharging the stimulus generalization effect on cellular function. How this actually occurs is not completely understood, but it is theorized that reviewing the various circumstances of a traumatic event during meditation for example, may reactivate the stress-released hormonal substances that originally encoded that event at the cellular level. The cellular memory is then brought into contact with normal cognitive function thus allowing the traumatic memory to be therapeutically reframed.</p>
 			<p>As far as diagnostics go in Brain Body Medicine, our concern is focused more on treating the whole person and developing whole body wellness, rather than on individual body parts or areas of the body that are acting as the primary indicators (through the displaying of illness, malfunction or disease) of imbalance in the body. Understanding the causes of illness, and recognizing the traumatic experiences, is an important part of the healing process, as is recognizing the conditions that activate the traumatic memories and their associated responses (Pavlov’s Bell).</p>
			<p>However real healing does not begin until we are ready to move beyond the cause of illness and begin to focus on the cause of wellness. Regardless of what the illness, disease or problem is or what the traumatic experience was, the treatment for healing is all the same. While we may feel we are “working on our healing” while we are exploring the causes of illness or disease. The real healing only begins once the focus is on developing wellness.</p>
			<p>The impact of prolonged stress, our beliefs and perceptions, including the notion of traumatic beliefs can create illness and disease in the body. Perfect health is the goal and complete wellness must be the focus. Because the traumatic memories are stored in the cells and not simple invisible wisps floating around in our unconscious minds, we do not need what all of these traumatic memories are in order to reprogram or remove them which can potentially take a lifetime. Whatever the illness or disease is and whatever its cause might be, the treatments are the same.</p>
